# BookEM

The objective of the app is to let members of organizations to book **resources** inside these
organizations. These **resources** can be cars, meeting rooms, video projectors, lighting systems, apartments,
houses, rooms and services.
**Organizations**and **resources** are managed by admins. Bookings and **reservations** of
assets/resources are also managed by **admins**. Some **resources** can be automatically booked
while others need approval. It depends on the settings of each **resource**.
Each **resource** has a name and is represented by an icon. Each resource can be reserved in
time slots. Each time slot can be named as well.
Below are diagrams that describe the main functionalities of users and admins.
